-----Data Types----
The  type of data in variables we  store  are called "Data Types"
Java allows to use  different Kinds of data types. 
Data is important part of a program.All the processing we do upon Data.
Depending on the value we can select the DateType
Here are Predefined Datatypes in java.
1.Integral
 a)byte
 b)short
 c)int
 d)long
2.Floating point
 a)float
 b)double
3.Char 
4.Boolean  
---Range and size of the DataTypes---
  Type    size(in bytes)
  byte      1
  short     2
   int        4
   long     8
   float     4
  double  8
  char       2
  boolean (not mentioned) 
boolean only stores two values either true or false.Default value is false.
byte,short,int,long all of them store the integer values only but they are vary in size.
float and double are used to store the numbers with decimal points.
float can store 6-7 values after the decimal point so it called as single precision.
double can store 14-15values after the decimal point so it called as  double precision.It can store more precise values.
char can store only positive values.

-----Variables----
Variables are used for storing the data in memory.
During execution we can change the value of a variable.
First we declare the variable then we have to store the data.
Declaration of a variable:
datatype variablename;
int a;
float f;
Intialization  of a variable:
int b=7;
Whenever we declare a variable the memory is allocated for a variable.
There are some rules are there to declare a variable:
1.case sensitive
2.contains Alphabets,Numbers,_,$
eg:abc_12,ab$2
3.Starts with Alphabet,_or$
4.variable name should not be a keyword
eg:if,else,abstract etc ..  there are some reserved words .These words can not be used as variables in programs
5.should not be a class Name(if class name is in use)
class name and variable name should not be same in a program.
6.No Limit on Length of a variable name but try to use relevant name.
Follow camelcase for naming of a variable.It is one of the convention 
byte rollNumber;
float averagrMarksOfStudent;


Sample programs:
class Variables
{
   public static void main(String args[])
    {
                   System.out.println(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
	System.out.println(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
	System.out.println(Integer.BYTES);
	System.out.println(Integer.SIZE);
	System.out.println(Float.MIN_VALUE);
	System.out.println(Float.MAX_VALUE);
	System.out.println(Float.BYTES);
	System.out.println(Float.SIZE);
	
    }
}
//output

class Variables
{
   public static void main(String args[])
    {
                  int a=10;
                    System.out.println(a);
                   a=978;
	System.out.println(a);
    }
}

//output:
10
978

----Literals----
Literals  are constant values used in the program
There are different types of Literals.
* int literals-representing integer types
*float and double literals-representing decimal type
*char literals-representing characters in single quotes
*string literals-representing characters in double quotes.
Literals are written based upon datatypes.
int literals can be represented indifferent number system
Decimal
Binary
Octal
HexaDecimal
L or l -long
F or f -Float
D or d-Double
' '-char
true/false-Boolean

//Sample programs
 
class SampleLiterals
{
  public static void main(String args[])
   {
     byte b1=10;
     byte b2=0b1010;
     byte b3=012;
     byte b4=0xA;
     float f=12.45f;
      int c=999999999l
     System.out.println(b1);
     System.out.println(b2);
     System.out.println(b3);
     System.out.println(b4);
     System.out.println(c);
     System.out.println(f);
  }
}
//Output
10

-----Compiler And Interpreter-------
They both translate Source code into machine understandable code.
Interpreter can translate line by line.
These are bit slower.
These languages are easy to learn and take less time to develop

Compiler will compile only once.
They are faster.
These languages takes time to learn and to develop.
we can execute many times once we can compile.

Java is a Hybrid Programming language.It can use both compiler and interpreter.
Compiler will read the source code then it generate class file for the source file.It has byte code and it is error free.
JVM  contains Interpreter and JIT compiler.It will convert the byte code into machine code .
Then it will execute the program via os.
The way it interacts with os called System calls.
JVM is responsible for executing java programs.

------Java Features/Buzz words-----
1)simple
2)Secure
  It cannot infected by  virus or malware .It has a security verifier in JVM
3)Portable
Java Program can run on any platform.
4)Object-Oriented
It is a Paradigm.some of the  principles are abstraction,Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism
5)Robust
They  never crash in worst conditions .This is achieved with Excepption Handling.
6)MultiThreaded:
Java  supports Multithreading.It can run simultaneously.
7)Architecture
Java can run on any Architecture.It is Architecture Neutral
8)High Performance:
Though it is interpreted .It has high Performance.
9)Distributed and dynamic
Java supports distributed computing
